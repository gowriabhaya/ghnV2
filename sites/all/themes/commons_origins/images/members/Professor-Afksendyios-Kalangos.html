        <hr />
        <p>Prof. Afksendiyos Kalangos is head of Department of Cardiovascular Surgery at University Hospital of Geneva.  </p>
        <p>As one of the first supporters of the GHN initiative, Professor Kalangos acts as an advisor to all levels of the project.  His extensive experience in humanitarian medicine through « Hearts for All » has also given Professor Kalangos in depth incite into the issues in humanitarian medicine and have been key to the structure of the Platform.  </p>
        <p>Dr Afksendiyos Kalangos of Greek origin, was born in Istanbul in 1960. He graduated from a French college in 1978 and from medical school in 1984. After a long period  of training in cardiovascular surgery in London, USA and Paris, he was nominated professor of cardiovascular surgery at the University of Istanbul in 1995 and then became staff surgeon at the University Hospital of Geneva in 1998. Finally, he was appointed chairman of the department of cardiovascular surgery in 2001 and director of the cardiovascular centre in 2011.  </p>
        <p>Thanks to ‘Hearts for All’, over 10,000 poor children suffering from congenital or acquired heart diseases have been treated over the last 6 years, especially in their own countries. The approach to humanitarian medicine is changing. Dr Kalangos moves away from the old concept of bringing and treating these children in developed countries, towards a new concept of providing specific medical care to these children in their own countries. </p>
        <p>Consequently, many heart institutes have been created or restored in Eritrea, Georgia, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mozambique, Morocco, Algeria, and soon these facilities will be extended to new demanding countries such as Cameroun and Vietnam. Young doctors and nurses are also trained in these local centers during cardio logical or surgical missions carried out by teams affiliated to his association. </p>
        <p>Dr Kalangos says that this policy will continue until these reference centers are fully autonomous and able to coordinate the same medical activities in their neighboring countries. Moreover, a telemedicine program is underway between the Department of Dr Kalongs in Geneva and these institutes for the benefit of the same geographic areas in order to reinforce the self-perpetuating process of training people locally. </p>
        <p>Dr Kalangos strongly believes that the future of humanitarian medicine resides within native countries where a new generation of enthusiastic and motivated practitioners awaits the challenge of treating their children themselves. <br />
