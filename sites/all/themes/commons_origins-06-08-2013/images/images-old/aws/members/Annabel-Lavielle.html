        <p>Annabel has dual citizenship with the United Kingdom and France. She currently lives with her spouse and three teenage daughters in San Francisco. </p>
        <p>She formerly owned a for-profit service company, Corporate Relocations, in Paris that provides services to Human Resources departments for their expatriates. After the company’s rapid growth, it was sold to Prudential in 2001. Shortly after, Annabel gained a Masters in Humanitarian Action at the Paris XII. This interest led her to work with NGOs in France including a nonprofit advocating child’s rights; and then a disaster relief NGO, “Premiere Urgence”. </p>
        <p>Upon her arrival in San Francisco in 2007, Annabel volunteered with several nonprofits and graduated with a Masters in nonprofit administration from the University of San Francisco. </p>
        <p>Leading from her studies she established the Global Heart Network. The purpose of her research was to determine if there is a need for a collaborative platform to specifically support nonprofits and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the field of cardiac care in the developing world. </p>
        <p>Annabel is passionate about building partnerships in cross-sector collaboration.   She is also the mother of a CHD survivor and has worked with several nonprofits working in this field. With gratitude for the excellent health care and support that they received in London, Paris and San Francisco, the GHN is being created as an effort to assist other individuals and families also affected by Heart Disease, in countries with less access to quality care. </p>
        <p>Together with her co-founders, Annabel is committed to the fundamental principle of each individual’s right to enjoy their highest attainable standard of health regardless of race, religion, political belief, and economic or social condition. <br />
